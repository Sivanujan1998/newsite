<img src="pegeon.jpg" height=250 width=480><br><font face="Algerian" color=red >Pigeon Island</font><br>Floating in the great blue 1km offshore, Pigeon Island, with its powdery white sands and glittering coral gardens, tantalises with possibilities. A nesting area for rock pigeons, the island is beautiful enough, with rock pools and paths running through thickets, but it’s the underwater landscape that’s the real star. The reef here is shallow, making snorkelling almost as satisfying as diving, and it’s home to dozens of corals, hundreds of reef fish (including blacktip reef sharks) and turtles.Note that the recent surge in tourism has damaged the reef to a degree, so don't expect a pristine marine environment. Close to the shore, some day trippers stomp all over shallow coral.

Though smaller in size than the neighbouring islands, it's the archipelago's top destination for travellers interested in Sri Lanka's cultural heritage, as Nainativu is a significant pilgrimage site in the first place. The modern Sinhala name of Nainativu is 'Nagadipa', also transcribed Nagadeepa, not to be confused with the homonymic ancient Pali term, which in Sri lanka's chronicles' is a designation of the entire Jaffna Peninsula. The ancient Tamil name of the island was Manipallavam. During the Dutch colonial period it was called Harlem.
